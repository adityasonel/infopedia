Infopedia is a starting point for React Native application. This project is configured with redux, redux saga, redux thunk
and axios. Latest version of react-navigation with NavigationService instead of Redux Integration.


## Scalability Factor

This Type based Architecture scales smoothly for small - medium apps. If you guys are building a very large application I would suggest using the following feature based architecture which will be more developer friendly with ease of scaling.

## Features

* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
* [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) 
* [React Native Gesture Handler](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler) 
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* [Eslint](http://eslint.org/) ([Airbnb config](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb))

## Prerequisites

* [Node](https://nodejs.org) v8.10 (it is recommended to install it via [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* A development machine set up for React Native by following [these instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo, `https://github.com/adityasonel/infopedia.git <your project name>`
2. Go to project's root directory, `cd <your project name>`
3. Remove `.git` folder,  `rm -rf .git`
4. Open `package.json` and change the `name` property with your project name
5. Open `index.js` and replace `'Infopedia'` by your project name
6. Open `app.json` and replace `'Infopedia'` by your project name 

7. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies

8. Run `react-native eject` to upgrade and add iOS & Android Folders.
  
9. Run `react-native link`

10. Latest versions of react-naviagtion uses gesture handler which is native module. For android you have to do some additional steps to configure them. Follow [these instructions](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html)

## FYI: Navigation should work fine even without these but when u need gestures or drawer navigation you need this setup

11. Start the packager with `npm start`
12. Connect a mobile device to your development machine
13. Run the test application:
  * On Android:
    * Run `react-native run-android`
  * On iOS:
    * Open `ios/YourReactProject.xcodeproj` in Xcode
    * Hit `Run` after selecting the desired device
14. Enjoy!!!
